# function
- It linked with a well define task.
- Or can say it is a block of code that perform a specific task.
- It is a reusable code.

# why
Suppose you have a task that you have to perform multiple times in your program then you can write a function for that task and you can call that function whenever you want to perform that task.
Mean Function reduce the redundancy of code.

# syntax
```cpp
return_type function_name(parameters){
    // code
}
```
if function does not return anything then return_type is void.

# what is return 0
meaning of return 0 in c++ programming is the program has been executed successfully without any error.

# why main function call automatically
main function is the entry point of the program. When we run the program, the operating system automatically calls the main function.

# return 1 vs return -1
return 1 means the program has been executed successfully but return -1 means the program has been executed with some error.

# function order


# function call stack
- It is a stack data structure.
- It is used to store the function call.
- When a function is called, the function call is pushed into the stack.
- When the function is returned, the function call is pop from the stack.

# pass by value vs pass by reference
pass by value: Value of the actual parameter is copied into the formal parameter.
pass by reference: Address of the actual parameter is copied into the formal parameter.
